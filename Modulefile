description 'Install and configure syslog-ng using puppet 3.

The syslogng module aims to be a complete solution for all things
syslog-ng. It comes with a ready to use default configuration
for lots of services.

The module will probably work on most unix systems since 
syslog-ng packages seem to be named consistantly on somewhat 
sane platforms. Testing was only done on gentoo so far though.

It is no where near to being finished. I am publishing this
version to solicit feedback and find contributors.

The module adheres to semver.org versioning standards.'

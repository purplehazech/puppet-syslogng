description 'Install and configure syslog-ng with puppet 3.

The syslogng puppet module aims to be a complete solution for
all things syslog-ng. It comes with a ready to use default
configuration for lots of services.

The module will probably work on most unix systems since
syslog-ng packages seem to be named consistantly on all
sane platforms. Testing was only done on gentoo so far but
as said, that should not really matter for this one.

It is no where near to being finished. I am publishing this
version to solicit feedback and find contributors.

The module adheres to semver.org versioning standards.'
